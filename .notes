auth service will use cloudinary to upload the photo ; has no other choice 
cannot send binary values via kafka
user service will delete the photo

we need to add throttler

synchronization problem in created_at between all entities

postgis integration , subscriper for index -> scan the full table for the neareset x sessions is not worth it 

critical bug found: 
even after deleting the jwt token from the request the user can got it and enter the protected route because the jwt token is still valid and the user can use it until it expires

order in location is [lng, lat]

we will add media service: for only uploading , removing pics no db at all 
//user register flow api-gateway -> auth service (emitting event to user service) -> creating the user 
//then another request to media service to update photo 
//db for user service will be a nullable public_id contains the url of the image 
//for the session will be another table (sessionId,public_url)
